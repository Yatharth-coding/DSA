1. If 2 recursion call are made at once then first recursion call which is written will be executed first fully
2. `return f(n-1) + f(n-2)` here when  when f(n-1)  givers the answer then f(n-2) will go for the calculation of f(n-2)
3. printing subsequence or combination question think of recursion
4. pick & non pick in an array
5. go by while method for finding a^b instead of using Math.pow(a,b) as it lose precision for large  exponent 
6. how to copy an array into new array
    
    ```java
    Using Arrays.copyOf():
    
    import java.util.Arrays;
    
    int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    
    int[] copy = Arrays.copyOf(arr, arr.length);
    
    The second argument is the new array length; using arr.length copies the whole array.
    ```
    
7. While passing to the function don’t pass like func(ls.add(2)) because it will pass boolean add before passing
8. Graph coloring to be done after doing graph
9. if you want to return no’s in array form without creating and array then do `return new int[ ]{a,b}`
10. Addition of strings takes time depending upon their length
11. good question - 29
12. Not able to find how to find the majority element in hash map
13. `Arrays.fill(arr,-1 ) ;` 
14. `int mod = (int)1e9 + 7 ;`
